# Roadmap to Embedded Engineering

This repository should serve as a guide to everybody who wants to study software and hardware for embedded systems but doesn't know where to start.

## Motivation

Maybe some undergratuate students who wants to study and work with embedded systems have found some difficulty to know what to study. Many are used to work with Arduino, which is a good start, but when it comes to make prototypes and projects more like real world projects, making hardware and software more professional, it's hard to know the best way to do it.

I notice the problem when I started to look for internships and Jr. jobs. The companies are always asking for knowledge that the university doesn't teach usually. Of course, if you are a Computer Engineering student or some course related, you'll have a strong base to work   in this area. But this isn't enough.

To work serious with embedded systems, some preparation is necessary, in order to achieve the knowledge needed to work with both universes: **software and hardware**.

## How will this works

The main goal here is to study most of the things needed to work with embedded engineering. With a lot of research I've done a collection of subjects that we need to know. Based on what professionals in the field says and what internships and junior jobs asks, we'll study the main topics in order to be prepared.
